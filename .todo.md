# Todo

- Bypass IP restrictions, using AnonSurf or some form of IP spoofing.
- - Check what this would look like using TOR etc etc
- - Or we can try to use not the API but the general webpage of Github to find user data

### Current Limitations

- Unable to scan large amounts of Accounts, due to IP restrictions.
- Only points in direction of search. Is not enough of an OSINT tool yet.
